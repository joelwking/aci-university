# aci-university
Training environment for WWT ACI University students. It creates a virtual machine with Ansible installed along with a sample playbook, Jinja template and XML file to create a tenant in an ACI fabric and add subnets to a bridge domain.

## Instructions
Create a directory called aci-university, enter it, and use an editor to place the contents of the Vagrantfile from https://github.com/joelwking/aci-university to a work directory on your laptop.  If you have git installed on your laptop, you can create a work directory, enter it and clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/joelwking/aci-university.git
```

Issue the command `vagrant up` to bring up the virtual machine, then `vagrant ssh` to logon.

Enter the working directory:
```
cd aci-university/ansible/playbooks/
```
Modify the inventory file and to reference your training ACI fabric name or IP address
```
sudo vi hosts
```
Modify the passwords.yml file to use your training fabric username and password
```
sudo vi passwords.yml
```
Encrypt the passwords.yml file
```
sudo andible-vault encrypt passwords.yml
sudo cat passwords.yml
```
Review the playbook 
```
sudo vi jinja2_loop.yml
```
Review the Jinja template file in ./templates
```
cat ./templates/*
```
Review the XML file used to create the tenant
```
cat ./files/*
```
Run the playbook to create a tenant and update the subnets in the bridge domain, you 
will be prompted for the vault password used to encrypt the file.
```
sudo ansible-playbook jinja2_loop.yml --ask-vault
```
The output should look like the following:
```
Vault password:

```
Logon the APIC and examine the Tenant you created.

from your environment.
